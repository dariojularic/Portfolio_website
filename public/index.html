            digital realities. With over four years of experience, I’ve honed my
            skills in crafting responsive, high-performance websites and web

            clean code, designing intuitive user experiences, and ensuring every
            project runs smoothly across devices.
            <br /><br />
            Whether it’s a bold startup site or a personal portfolio, I’m here

          <h2>SKILLS</h2>
          <p>
            Over the years, I’ve mastered front-end technologies like React,
            JavaScript, HTML and Tailwind CSS to create pixel-perfect, responsive
            interfaces that users love.
            <br /><br />
            On the back-end, I’m comfortable with Node.js and Express, ensuring
            your site runs fast and secure. I’m also well-versed in optimizing
            performance, debugging complex issues, and integrating APIs to add
            that extra functionality.
            <br /><br />
            Beyond the tech, I bring a problem-solving mindset and a commitment
            to delivering projects that are as reliable as they are beautiful.
